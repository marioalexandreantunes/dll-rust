; AutoIt example for rust_dll.dll (Windows)
; =====================
; This script demonstrates how to:
;   - Load the Rust-built DLL (32-bit path shown below)
;   - Call exported functions that return heap-allocated C strings
;   - Read the returned strings using DllStructCreate
;   - Free the memory on the DLL side using `free_string`
;
; Important
;   - The DLL returns pointers to heap-allocated strings. You must call `free_string` once per pointer.
;   - Ensure the path and CPU architecture match your environment:
;       * For 32-bit DLL:  target\i686-pc-windows-msvc\release\rust_dll.dll (AutoIt must run as 32-bit)
;       * For 64-bit DLL:  target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\rust_dll.dll (AutoIt must run as 64-bit)
;   - Buffer sizes (char[256], char[512]) must be large enough for your strings; increase if needed.
;   - Encoding: the DLL uses UTF-8 internally. AutoIt may treat char buffers as ANSI. For fully correct UTF-8 handling,
;     consider reading bytes and converting with BinaryToString(..., 4). For simple ASCII/ANSI content, this approach works.
;
